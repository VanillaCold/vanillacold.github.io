          <p>
            Solar Spore is a gameplay overhaul mod I'm making for Spore: Galactic Adventures.
            <br>It adds a handful of features to some stages, but in the future will focus mainly on the Space Stage.
            <br>Currently, the following features are fully implemented:

            <ul>

              <li>Nests have been completely removed and creatures now wander around more; acting like small packs of rogues.</li>
              <li>The Creature Stage has been extended to twice its vanilla length.</li>
              <li>Buildings and vehicles are now more expensive.</li>
              <li>Extinction requires 15 kills instead of 3-7 kills.</li>
              <li>Creatures packs are much larger than nest sizes in the vanilla game.</li>
              <li><span class="red">[UNSTABLE]</span> Solar systems can now have 3-75 planets.</li>
              <li>The price of a T3 planet has gone down - however, buidings are now factored into the price.</li>
              <li>New space tools have been added. (Level 4 (Imperial) versions of various vanilla tools, alongside purchasable versions of some archetype tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

          <p>
            Solar Spore currently doesn't add too much to the game, but I still have plans for features to add to the future.
            <br>The features that I'm currently developing are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>A Research Menu, so that custom tools can be unlocked in a different way than badges.</li>
              <li>Tier-2 Archetype Abilities, unlocked late in the game through research.</li>
              <li>Archetype-exclusive main weapons - replacing the Laser tool for all archetypes but Wanderer</li>
              <li>An overhaul to shields - they won't be permanent anymore, but will instead have a limited HP</li>
              <li>Improved NPC weaponry - lasers that wear down shields, and cannons that can transport the ships closer to you.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </td>
        </tr>


        <tr class="centercontainer centerheight">

        <td style="margin-bottom:120px">
          <p>
            In addition to these, I also have plans for the following - though I haven't made any significant progress in developing them:
            <ul>
              <li>A late-game questline involving the Grox, culminating in a quest to destroy them in an all-out fast-paced war.</li>
              <li>New strength upgrades to Grox ships - they will be resistent to most player weapons in the early game, using shields to defend themseles.</li>
              <li>Strong late-game weaponry that can break even the strongest of shields.</li>
              <li>Interplanetary space battles</li>
            </ul>
